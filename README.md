## Tic Tac Toe Game in C

#### Notes:

  1. IMPORTANT!! Can you make this playable in PVP and PVC?  
	Note: Read on [Minimax algorithm][link 1] for PvC. Read [this][link 2] also.
  2. Can we implement a better draw checking code that does not need a counter for filled boxes?  

#### New Modifications:

  1.  Initial code is complete to deploy. (15-Dec-2018)  
  2.  Successfully(?) implemented logic to run the game multiple times based on user's choice. (17-Dec-2018)  

#### To add:

  1. Implement ttt_list as a *2d array*. Try to think how to make it work for 5x5 and 7x7 boards.  
	Note: Making the board names relevant as 00, 01, 02,... RowColumn may prove beneficial. Use string.h for ease maybe?)
  2. New code for 5x5 and 7x7 print_board function (what if an automated drawing loop can be designed for it? It should print the cell numbers into the cells also.)
